🫀 Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Introduction:

Heart failure is a serious medical condition that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in enhancing patient outcomes, facilitating timely intervention, and mitigating associated health risks. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart failure based on clinical features. The goal is to develop and evaluate multiple classification models to determine the most effective approach for accurate prediction.

🎯 Problem Statement: 

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the occurrence of heart failure from clinical attributes such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Blood pressure
- Serum creatinine level
- Other relevant health indicators

Several classification algorithms are implemented and compared, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
- Random Forest Classifier

⚙️ Data Preprocessing: 

To ensure model reliability, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps such as:
- Handling missing values
- Scaling numerical features
- Encoding categorical variables
- Applying feature engineering techniques

These steps standardized the dataset for consistent training and evaluation across all models.

🧠 Model Training & Evaluation:
- The dataset was split into training and testing sets.
- Each model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.
- Performance metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Hyperparameter tuning was performed to enhance performance and reduce overfitting/underfitting.

✅ Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting heart failure from clinical data.
- Best-performing models: Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.
- Key contribution: A reliable predictive framework that could support healthcare professionals in early detection and preventive care.
By combining predictive analytics with clinical expertise, this work contributes toward building data-driven healthcare solutions that improve patient outcomes.
